## Topic 2 - Digital Humanities

AR showed a couple of tools and methods for creating and working with humanities data, especially textual data.

* For doing [Topic Modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model), there is a tool called [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) which allows to explore single texts or a corpus of texts in your browser. Voyant allows you to drag-and-drop a text into the interface and analyse it; you can also upload a single text or a corpus of texts. It is, however, not agnostic to formats. Html and plain text are recommended. Check out the documentation and tutorials on the [Voyant website](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sgsinclair/Voyant)

* In many humanities disciplines, the data that is created is called a (scholarly) edition. This is often historically, literarily, philosophically or culturally significant texts, that have been transcribed from their original manuscripts or prints in a way that makes them more accessible by modern day researchers and students. Editions are often accompanied by commentaries, glossaries (that explain words and phraes that have changed in meaning or have disappeared from common knowledge) and other material that helps putting the old texts into context. Nowadays, these editions are made to be not just usable by humans but also by machines. IN order to allow this, they are most often coded in XML, which allows for rich markup. ESpecially one "dialect" of XML has been developed for creating editions, called TEI (Text Encoding Initiative Standard). An example of a modern - digital - edition of old texts can be found on the website of the [German Text Archive](http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/), but there are many more for all kinds of texts, languages and past epoches.

* Transcribing any text by hand is very time consuming (and humans make errors, too). There are a lot of tools that can help transcribing texts that are printed in modern times, but much less exist for older printed texts - let alone handwritten material. Since machine learning took off a couple of years ago, there has been significant improvement of pattern recognition algorithms (OCR, Optical Character Recognition) and tools that use those. One of the most versatile tools for this is [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/), which was especially developed to help transcribe handwritten material. After some training, handwritten material is transcribed with high accuracy by a machine and the researcher can do finishing touches instead of spending her time doing all the work manually.
