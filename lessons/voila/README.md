# Introduction

Voila is a Python module that can turn Jupyter notebooks with widgets into interactive web applications.
[https://github.com/QuantStack/voila]
Examples: [https://voila-gallery.org/services/gallery/]
 
# How to use it

```conda install -c conda-forge voila```

```voila yournotebook.ipynb```
 
To run the examples make sure all dependencies are installed. In particular ```bgplot``` (https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot)
 
# Application

Could this be useful for researchers to share their data with others? Jupyter notebooks can be quite overwhelming. Could be useful to use during presentations.

Could be smart to organize a workshop on Voilá, maybe during the research bazaar?
