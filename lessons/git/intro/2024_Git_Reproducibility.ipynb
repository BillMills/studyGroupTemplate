    "\n",
    "The concept of reproducibility is just that \\- **is your work reproducible**? Reproduction of methods, analyses and results is important not only in scientific research but also in day\\-to\\-day activities. It is a major factor that determines if **research results are consistent and valid** If your work is reproducible, then **valid experiments and results build authentic discoveries that are more reliable** in your field and help develop robust literature for future research studies. While reproducibility ensures that your work is accurate and reliable, it can also **encourage community involvement and participation**. _**Remember, if your foundation is shaky then so is all the work built upon it**_\n",

    "There are different fields of reproducibility :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scientific** Reproducibility \\- **Can your results be reproduced from your methods?**\n",
    "2. **Computational** Reproducibility \\- **Can your results be reproduced from your code?**\n",
    "3. **Statistical** Reproducibility \\- **Are your methods robust enough to reproduce your results?**\n",

    "- Privacy and security\n",
    "- Differences between fields\n",

    "\n",
    "One way to ensure reproducibility is to have a well\\-organized project workflow and management. A common way to organize your files is by **project i.e. a project\\-oriented workflow**. Here, each project that you are working on is **self\\-contained in its own folder**, with its **different data types in different folders**. I.e. your raw data should be in a different folder than your processed data, documents and files should be in another folder etc. \n",

    "## File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a default file structure can also help with your own mental organization of your file paths. There are two types of file paths: **absolute and relative**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute file paths **start at your root file and mention every directory before arriving at your file**. For example, if I wanted to get the absolute file path of the CSV in the above figure, it would look something like this: `/Users/yeshoda/Desktop/Projects/Salt Tolerance/Chlamy sample - Sheet1.csv`, Where `Chlamy sample - Sheet1.csv` is the name of my file, which is located in the `Salt Tolerance/` folder. This folder is in the `Projects/` folder which is on my `Desktop/` \\(also a folder\\), within my user folder \\(`yeshoda/`\\), within the`Users/` folder in the **root** \\(`/`\\). The / **denotes a directory \\(also known as a folder\\)**. Absolute file paths are useful when trying to find files you're looking for, however, **they are sensitive to breaking**. For example, if I moved `Projects/` to `Documents/` rather than `Desktop/` my path will **no longer work and will cause an error**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative file paths are **relative to the current directory that you are working in**. Your current directory will be noted with a ./ and the parent directory will be denoted with ../ For example if I am in the `Figures/` directory and wish to go to the `References/` directory I can type: `cd ../References/.` Here I'm using the `cd` command which stands for **change directory**, and then specify I want to move into my parent folder Salt Tolerance \\(`../`\\) and then into `References/.` The benefit of using absolute paths is that now if I moved `Projects/` to `Documents/` rather than `Desktop/` **my path still works**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**There is no right or wrong file path format**! **Choose the one that works for you and for the type of project that you have.** If you know the hierarchy of your folders, relative paths might serve better. However, if you do not know the hierarchy but know where your file is in general then an absolute path might serve better. \n",

    "| Add | Adding your changes to the “Staging” area|\n",

    "| Checkout | Moving from one branch to another|\n",
    "| Clone | Make a copy of the your GitHub repo on your local computer|\n",
    "| Commit | Takes the files in your staging area and store their changes permanently in your Git directory|\n",
    "| Head | Head is a reference or pointer of the latest commit on your branch, there can only be one head at a time. You can move the head to a different commit by using checkout - this is known as a detatched head |\n",
    "| Merge | Incorporate changes into the branch you are on|\n",
    "| Pull | A combination of fetch and merge. This fetches the files from the remote repo and merges them with your local files|\n",
    "| Pull Request | Term used in collaboration. You “issue a pull request” to the owner of the upstream repo asking them to pull your changes into their repo (accept your work)|\n",
