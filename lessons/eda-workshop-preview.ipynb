    "# Exploratory data analysis in Python with pandas and seaborn\n",
    "In this workshop we are going to explore a dataset using two powerful Python libraries: [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/). We will see that pandas provides us with flexible data structures and powerful methods to manipulate them, while seaborn will make sure that we get some sexy plots in the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few concepts before we get started:\n",
    "- What pandas gives you is essentially two data structures: the [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe), which is a 2D (tabular) labelled data structure, and the [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#series), which is basically a 1D DataFrame. \n",
    "- You can create dataframes and series in a number of ways. \n",
    "- A dataframe can contain data of basically any type: integers, floating point numbers, strings, Python objects).\n",
    "- Once your data is in a pandas dataframe, you have at your disposal a vast arsenal of methods to slice it, index it, and manipulate it. Processing steps that would normally give you a headache if you were working with standard tools (or at least require several lines of code) will become one-liners in pandas.\n",
    "- Seaborn builds on top of pandas and allows to make amazing plots with only a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we use a common dataset on the sinking of the Titanic, which contains information about passangers and on whether they survived the disaster. "

    "## Selecting and indexing data\n",
    "A great feature of pandas data structures is that we have powerful ways of selecting parts of our data, for instance entries that satisfy certain criteria. Indexing can be done by label using `.loc` or by position with `.iloc`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose `df` is a dataframe. If you write `df.loc[:, 1]`, then `1` is interpreted by pandas as the label, so it will look for a column called `1`. On the other hand, `df.iloc[:, 1]` will give you the second column, regardless of what its name is. Same thing if we index rows: `df.loc[2, :]` will look in `df.index` to find row whose index is `2`, whereas `df.iloc[2, :]` will give you the third row, even if the value of its index is `3789` or `power_rangers`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is often confusing for people who are getting started with pandas. Chances are, you probably only ever indexed by position when working with numeric arrays, so be aware of this difference when working with pandas dataframes. **As always**, the best way to learn about this is to read [pandas wonderful docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html)."
