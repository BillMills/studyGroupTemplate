StudyGroup 2019-09-12 - Instructor Development

Python - 1 episode
- check for correct Python version with print statement - use sticky notes
- explaining numpy can cause confusion
- loadtxt can create issues
  - spelling wrong
  - learner in wrong directory
  - installation guide information overflow
  - alternatives to using numpy for the import?
- explain data types --- clarify "expectations" for Python when dealing with variables
- Indexes
  - where are []
  - why do we start from 0 not 1
  - TASK for next instructor dev lesson: where to find character map on different OS (on screen keyboard)
- Slicing
  - could be skipped or omitted (keep up until "tripledata")
- Numpy functions min / max / std
  - usually create positive feedback in learners
- Axes
  - which axis is 0 and which is 1
  - refer to "this is convention in Python" to not confuse learners
- Matplotlib
  - spelling can cause issues
  - plot might have a different colour depending on version of Matplotlib
  - reasoning behind the data and the plots is confusing (inflammation data)
  - perhaps change data to something more relatable?
  - making subplots in a row: use copy-and-paste with Etherpad to avoid lots of typing and spelling issues
- Exercises
  - instead of at the end of the episode, weave them in where they belong
  - chose a couple, not all (too time consuming)
  - perhaps make use of Mentimeter, Sokrativ, Kahoot or use screenshot on GooglePresentations and discuss in class
  - TASK: share Sokrativ or similar within the Carpentry@UiO community to avoid double work; create exercise corpus
  - libraries (numpy) --- call up documentation to have as reference for learners
  - pick and chose exercises that fit the learning objectives and address typical learner misconceptions and mistakes
