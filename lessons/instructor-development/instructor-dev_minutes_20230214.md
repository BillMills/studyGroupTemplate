# How to Launch a Workshop

 - **Authors**: Annika Rockenberger
 - **Research field**: Instructor Development
 - **Lesson Topic**: Introduction - How to Open/Start/Launch a Workshop

We have been looking into workshop introductions, or how to "launch" a workshop. The materials we used are from the Carpentries Instructor Training, [Chapter 23: Launches and Landings](https://preview.carpentries.org/instructor-training/23-introductions.html).

Here are eight aspects of an introdcution that the Carpentries highlight: 

1. Set positive first impressions
2. Introduce yourself effectively (and have other workshop leaders do the same)
3. Clarify learning objectives and expectations
4. Help learners learn about each other
5. Set the tone for the workshop
6. Collect baseline data on learners’ knowledge and motivation
7. Whet learners’ appetite for workshop content
8. Inform Learners of Logistics

Logistics for Carpentry@UiO workshops can be found in our [onboarding document](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/workshop_operations/onboarding-checklist.md).
