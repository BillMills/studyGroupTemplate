We went through the OSF interface and came up with some points that would be important to go through when organizing an OSF workshop, e.g. at the Research Bazaar:

- Is it possble to add different accounts for Add-ons e.g. different github accounts for one user?
- Discuss the use of DOI's and Registration. When should you create a DOI? When and why should you register your project
- Show how to generate different ways of citation, e.g. BibTex
- How to create a preprint and connect it to your OSF project? How to find pre-prints and make comments to them? What is the advantage of preprints?
- Discuss advantage of using OSF and/or other public collaboration platforms that can generate DOI in respect to publishing on your own web page.
