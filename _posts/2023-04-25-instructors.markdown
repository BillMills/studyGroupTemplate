**What's happening?**

We read the episode [Motivation and Demotivation](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html) from the Carpentries Instructor Training material and do a couple of the exercises.

"Teaching and learning are not the same process. [...] An instructor can make choices that facilitate the cognitive processes necessary for learning to occur. But any technique can fall flat when learners are not motivated. Worse, demotivation is contagious! Teaching or sharing a classroom with demotivated learners is not fun or rewarding. It can be tempting, especially for teachers facing burnout after strenuous and ineffectual effort, to blame learners for spoiling the classroom experience."
