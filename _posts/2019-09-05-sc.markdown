**Session leader**: Annika Rockenberger

We will meet to read the paper and discuss it. 

Based on the article by Wilson et al. "Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing" (2017) I would like to develop a lesson that could be taught Carpentries-style. It's not so much about computing but about general digital literacy and good routines, thus it is widely applicable.
