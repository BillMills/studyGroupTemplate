**Session leader**: Anne Fouilloux

Walk-through of the pre-prepared lesson (see [https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/IoT_arduino_nano/](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/IoT_arduino_nano/)) and discuss the way forward. The goal would be to add it in the Carpentries additional curriculum.

You do not need to know anything about Internet of Things. The main objective is to get feedback on the existing lesson.

Come and discuss with us how we can include new lesson in the Carpentries.
