**Session leader**: Annika Rockenberger

Based on the article by Wilson et al. "Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing" (2017) I would like to develop a lesson that could be taught Carpentries-style. It's not so much about computing but about general digital literacy and good routines, thus it is widely applicable.

We will discuss the content of a new lesson based on the ideas in the article.

- **Preparation**: read the paper mentioned.
- **When**: 19th September 2019
- **Time**: 16:00-18:00
- **Location**:  Niels Henrik Abels hus Room 209
